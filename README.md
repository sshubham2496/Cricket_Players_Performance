# Cricket Player Performance Dashboard | Power BI

This Power BI dashboard offers a comprehensive analysis of cricket players' performances. It features detailed metrics like batting average, strike rate, boundary percentage, and bowling economy, enabling a deep dive into players' strengths and weaknesses. This dashboard serves as an essential tool for cricket analysts, enthusiasts, and team strategists to assess player capabilities and make informed decisions.

In this project, I created a Power BI Dashboard that helps the user pick the Best 11 for the 2022 T20 Cricket Worldcup. This project was created with the help of CodeBasics. The Project contains 6 pages which show 5 essential orders of cricket format power hitters, middle order, finisher, allrounders, and fast bowlers. The 6th page displays the best 11 which can be changed by the user as per requirements. Around 15 new measures were created that show statistics of a player's performance which were used to display the top 5 cricketers for every group using the criteria displayed in the parameters file. Further, interactive tooltips were created which display player stats for each match. These tooltip stats also change depending on the group.

The .pbix file contains the created Power BI reports used in this project. 
The DAX measures file contains the measures created for this particular project.

Further, the T20 cricket approach file shows the final result of this project.
